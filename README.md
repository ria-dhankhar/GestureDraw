# 🎨 GestureDraw

GestureDraw is an AI-powered virtual painting app built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to draw on the screen using simple hand gestures — no mouse or touch required.

## 📌 Features

- ✍️ Draw using your index finger in mid-air
- 🎨 Switch colors with a two-finger gesture
- 🧼 Erase using a custom gesture
- 📸 Real-time hand tracking via webcam
- 💻 Clean UI overlay with virtual canvas
